		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>We are a small dedicated crew of pirate programmers (the adjective, pirate, not the verb, pirate) who have a real passion for software engineering and networking. We like to put a spin on things to keep things fun and interesting, hence the pirate theme, and we have spent many hours debating about how far to take the theme with every product we produce. Telecommunication is our current focus but we have released some other applications (Swashbucklers & First Mates) during our time as a company. These were our way to figure out how well we work as a team and to practise our practice before tackling our main goal: Ahoy!</p>

		<h2>Our Quest</h2>
		<p>Our quest is to expand the boundaries of online collaboration and communication without creating a dull enviroment for our users. If you enjoy working with others online and have a childish fondness for pirates, we have the products for you! We hope that our quest never truly ends as we hope to continously explore the seven seas of systems and software.</p>

		<h2>FAQ</h2>
		<h3>Why the Pirate Theme?</h3>
		<p>We are children.</p>
		<h3>How did you all meet?</h3>
		<p>We all worked for the same company and shared similar issues with how said company was managed. We also all bonded over complaining about the uninteresting and inefficient methods of programming and team management. So, we decide to leave and start our own company that would revolutionise the way softwares are designed and how teams are run. We also share a love of pirates, so our friendship was inevitable.</p>
